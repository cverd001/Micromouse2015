# CODE
- Implement PID controller
- Implement turnLeft() and turnRight() functions
- Implement code to get motor RPMs from encoders
- goBackward() makes it go forward?

## HARDWARE
- Left and right motors are not hooked up to the proper pins (goBackward() doesn't work)
- Figure out what is wrong with the breadboard (wires not connecting reliably)
- Add LEDs to prototype for use with phototransistors
- Colorcode jumper wires
